Time-series analysis of bodily temperature measurements

## Installation
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Setting up the data
First you need to add the data to the `./data/` folder. Do this by copying user files (with th prefix USER_00x, where the x is the ID of the user) to the data folder.

## Modifying the script
Change the ID of the user in the main script, to run the prediction for different users.

## Results
Results will be generated in the form of graphs, in the local directory (from which the `predict.py` script is run).
